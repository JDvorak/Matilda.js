# Studious.js
## v0.0.0.1alpha

This is a Javascript library for performing convenient inference on statistical topic models. It presently performs Latent Dirichlet Allocation by way of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

## Supported Techniques
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  - Sparse Gibbs Sampling

## Project Maturity

This project is in pre-alpha. This is _not_ yet a production library. Expect the interface to change drastically from week to week, and the functionality and performance to flucuate. Your code _will_ break as this project progresses.

## Dependencies
This is a standalone library.
